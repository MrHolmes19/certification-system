# RUTINARY TASKS

We have implemented 2 functions that run at all times (Always-on tasks).

## Clean up old files

This routine is triggered every day and is intended to delete all information for those completed or inactive operations that are older than 90 days. This is for the purpose of maintaining a controlled storage space.

## Shift reminder by email

This additional notification to those already mentioned is made one day before the scheduled appointment, to remind the client that they have to physically present themselves with their vehicle.
