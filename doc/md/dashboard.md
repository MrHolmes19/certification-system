# COMMAND BOARD

## Main interface

The dashboard is the section of the application that the administrator has to see the status of the operations and make decisions about them.
This section consists of a vertical navigation bar, which allows you to view different tables, perform quick filters on them and perform other actions such as modify rates, view and modify shifts, view business statistics, etc.

## Detail of operations

Each operation record has a magnifying glass to the left of everything in the "Detail" column. By clicking, you access a new interface, where you can consult information about the operation and execute decisions on all aspects of the operation. After completing the operation, the dates of all important events are saved, which allows tracking.

## Registration of companies

A client can enter as a company and access the benefit of a preferential rate. For this, the user must previously register said company, adding the pertinent information.

The administrator can at any time modify the information of each company and even disable it and with that restrict access to its operations
