# NOTIFICATIONS BY MAIL

Since the service process from start to finish involves the participation of both parties, communication between them is essential. For this reason, we have implemented notifications via email for both the client and the administrator.

## Customer Notifications

In all cases where the administrator accepts or rejects documentation, payment, shift or vehicle verification, or when uploading the certificate, an email will automatically be sent to notify the client of the next procedure.

All emails include a link or precise information on how to follow:

## Notifications to the Administrator

In the same way, the administrator receives an email every time a new client has entered or when the process requires his intervention.
