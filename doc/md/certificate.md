# UPLOAD AND DOWNLOAD THE CERTIFICATE

## Admin Side

Once the operation is in the "Waiting for certificate" status, the administrator will be able to upload the certificate granted by COPIME. The operation will go to the status of "Certificate Available".

## Client Side

When the client enters with the operation in the "Certificate Available" status, they will be redirected to the last interface, where they can download the files (the report and the certificate). You will have 90 days from when the certificate is uploaded to download it before it is deleted.
